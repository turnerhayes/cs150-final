<!--
Set the runtime camera capture configuration for the vision system.

Required:
	camMode: camera mode - see options below
	imageWidth: image width in pixels
	imageHeight: image height in pixels
	hasStereo: is capture mode stereo
	hasDepth: does capture mode produce depth info
	publishCloudToRos: should captured point cloud be published to ROS (only possible if
						VisionComponent is compiled with ROS support and hasDepth is true)

Optional:
	any additional fields the particular camera mode might need


CAM_MODE options:
      MONO_FW,
      STEREO_FW,
      STEREO_SYNC,
      MONO_V4L2,
      STEREO_V4L2,
      MONO_AVI,
      MONO_FILE,
      MULTI_FILE_LOG,
      MONO_UNREAL,
      KINECT (or XTION),
      KINECT_ONI, //from oni file
      SIM_PC1, //simulate kinect version 1 (rgb and disparity separately)
      SIM_PC2 (or PCD), //simulate kinect version w (pcd files)
      KINECT_PLUS, //kinect plus another rgb camera (mainly for calibration of robot system with multiple sensors)
      MDS, //firefly cameras and swiss ranger
      DRONE, //ar drone
      ROS,
      NAO,
      GSTREAMER, // H264-encoded stream via GStreamer


NOTE: to use the PR2 kinect topics, run openni with the following params:
$ roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch camera:=head_mount_kinect depth_registration:=true


Common topics for various ROS setups.

PR2 gazebo:
    /head_mount_kinect/rgb/image_raw
    /head_mount_kinect/depth/image_raw

PR2 (depth registered):
    /head_mount_kinect/rgb/image_color
    /head_mount_kinect/depth_registered/image_raw
    NOTE: /head_mount_kinect/depth(_registered)/image_raw is in millimeters and
        head_mount_kinect/depth(_registered)/image is supposedly in meters, but is never published
        so also set convertToMeters to true

PR2 (non depth registered):
    /head_mount_kinect/rgb/image_color
    /head_mount_kinect/depth/image_raw

PR2 other:
    /narrow_stereo/right/image_rect_color
    /narrow_stereo/left/image_rect_color
    /wide_stereo/right/image_rect_color
    /wide_stereo/left/image_rect_color
    /wide_stereo/points
