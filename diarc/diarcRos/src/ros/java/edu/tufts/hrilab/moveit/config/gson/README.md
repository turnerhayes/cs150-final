# What is this?
Everything found in this directory is a dummy class that MoveItComponentImpl will
dump values into based off of the JSON configurations. With that in mind, you probably don't
want to adjust these classes (unless you're adding functionality). Many of them are redundant
because that makes the creation of the JSON files much cleaner and easier.
